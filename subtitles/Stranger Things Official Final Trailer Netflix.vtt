00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.920
Something is coming, something hungry for

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.260
blood. What is it?

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.270
The demogorgon.

4
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.290
Deep shit? I have to go.

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.840
Later. See you tomorrow.

6
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.620
Good night, ladies.

7
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.450
Kiss your mom goodnight for me.

8
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.250
Will Buyers. Will is missing, I don't know

9
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.870
where he is. 99 out of 100 times kid goes

10
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.970
missing. The kid is with a parent or

11
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.770
relative. What about the other time?

12
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.180
What?

13
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.360
You said 99 out of 100.

14
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.050
What about the other time? The one.

15
00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.100
The one. Will, Will.

16
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.450
Guys, I really think we should turn back.

17
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.690
You guys hear that? That's not Will.

18
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.240
You're in trouble, aren't you?

19
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.150
We've sealed off this area.

20
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.990
Is where it came from? Yes.

21
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.850
And the girl?

22
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:26.930
She can't have gone far.

23
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.520
Find, three. You really think it was a

24
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.560
coincidence that we found the same place

25
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.260
where Will disappear? Something is going on

26
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.650
here.

27
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.080
What the hell? She knows about Will. Is there

28
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.910
any way that you could reach him?

29
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:56.460
Yes. What if this whole time I've been

30
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.770
looking for Will? She sniffed something

31
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:00.040
else.
